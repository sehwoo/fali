  The idea mostly came from http://960.gs/. However,
  there are twelve wrappers instead of just one, and
  there is only the twelve column variation. It isn't
  quite fluid width, but this does offer much more
  flexibility.
  
How to Use This Framework
  Wrappers
  There are 12 different wrappers. Each is centered, and
  there should be only one per page, though that isn't 
  necessary. This sets how wide the page is and how many
  columns the page can have.

  Columns
  With a wrapper of 12 columns, you can have up to twelve
  `width`s. For example, a site can have three 
  `.width4`s, or two `.width2`s and a `.width3` and then
  a `.width7`. A wrapper of 11 columns can have something
  like `.width2` and `.width9`.
