How to Use This Framework
=========================

Wrappers
--------

There are 12 different wrappers. Each is centered, and
there should be only one per page, though that isn't 
necessary.

Columns
-------

With a wrapper of 12 columns, you can have up to twelve
`width`s. For example, a site can have three 
`.width4`s, or two `.width2`s and a `.width3` and then
a `.width7`. A wrapper of 11 columns can have something
like `.width2` and `.width9`.
